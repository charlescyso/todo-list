# todo-list
My first todo list!

Made with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and webpacks.
Finished over the course of 10 days.
This was a fun challenge, combining a lot of learning when it came to using class constructors, webpacks, and ES6 modules. Similar to previous projects, I had to use a reference and it came useful around implementing class constructors. This is an area where I'm still having trouble with but luckily the use of class constructors was light in this project. I felt confident in DOM manipulation as I would research new strategies on how to target certain elements or change their attributes. I have a better understanding on how to organize my scripts so that they're not all jumbled into one file.
